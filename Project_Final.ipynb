The phase-to-phase relationship, described in \\n\\nSection 2.4.2.1, strongly in˚uences how requirements are managed. The project manager chooses the most \\neffective relationship for the project and documents this approach in the requirements management plan. Many of \\n\\nthe requirements management plan components are based on that relationship.\\nComponents of the requirements management plan can include, but are not limited to:\\nHow requirements activities will be planned, tracked, and reported;\\n Con˜guration management activities such as: how changes to the product will be initiated, how impacts \\n\\nwill be analyzed, how they will be traced, tracked, and reported, as well as the authorization levels \\n\\nrequired to approve these changes;\\nRequirements prioritization process;\\nProduct metrics that will be used and the rationale for using them; and\\nTraceability structure to re˚ect which requirement attributes will be captured on the traceability matrix.\\n5.2 Collect RequirementsCollect Requirements is the process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and \\nrequirements to meet project objectives.

Requirements include conditions or capabilities that are to be \\n\\nmet by the project or present in the product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed \\n\\nspeci˜cation. Requirements include the quanti˜ed and documented needs and expectations of the sponsor, \\n\\ncustomer, and other stakeholders. These requirements need to be elicited, analyzed, and recorded in enough detail \\n\\nto be included in the scope baseline and to be measured once project execution begins. Requirements become \\n\\nthe foundation of the WBS. Cost, schedule, quality planning, and sometimes procurement are all based upon \\n\\nthese requirements. The development of requirements begins with an analysis of the information contained in the \\n\\nproject charter (Section 4.1.3.1), the stakeholder register (Section 13.1.3.1) and the stakeholder management plan \\n(Section 13.2.3.1).Many organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical solutions, the \\nformer referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented. Requirements can \\n\\nbe grouped into classi˜cations allowing for further re˜nement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These \\n\\nclassi˜cations include:\\n Business requirements, which describe the higher-level needs of the organization as a whole, such as the \\n\\nbusiness issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been undertaken.\\nStakeholder requirements, which describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group.\\n Solution requirements, which describe features, functions, and characteristics of the product, service, \\n\\nor result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements are further \\n\\ngrouped into functional and nonfunctional requirements: ˜ Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. Examples include processes, \\n\\ndata, and interactions with the product.\\n ˜ Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe the environmental \\nconditions or qualities required for the product to be effective. Examples include: reliability, \\n\\nsecurity, performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc.\\n Transition requirements describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and training \\n\\nrequirements, needed to transition from the current ﬁas-isﬂ state to the future ﬁto-beﬂ state.\\n Project requirements, which describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project needs  \\nto meet. Quality requirements, which capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completion \\n\\nof a project deliverable or ful˜llment of other project requirements.Licensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.113©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n5 - PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT55.2.1 Collect Requirements: Inputs5.2.1.1 Scope Management PlanDescribed in Section 5.1.3.1.

The stakeholder register is used to identify stakeholders who can provide \\ninformation on the requirements. The stakeholder register also captures major requirements and main expectations \\n\\nstakeholders may have for the project.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.114©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n5 - PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT5.2.2 Collect Requirements: Tools and Techniques5.2.2.1 Interviews\\nAn interview is a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking to them directly. \\nIt is typically performed by asking prepared and spontaneous questions and recording the responses. Interviews \\n\\nare often conducted on an individual basis between an interviewer and an interviewee, but may involve multiple \\n\\ninterviewers and/or multiple interviewees. Interviewing experienced project participants, sponsors and other \\n\\nexecutives, and subject matter experts can aid in identifying and de˜ning the features and functions of the desired \\n\\nproduct deliverables. Interviews are also useful for obtaining con˜dential information.\\n5.2.2.2 Focus GroupsFocus groups bring together prequali˜ed stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about their \\nexpectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result. A trained moderator guides the group \\n\\nthrough an interactive discussion, designed to be more conversational than a one-on-one interview.\\n5.2.2.3 Facilitated Workshops\\nFacilitated workshops are focused sessions that bring key stakeholders together to de˜ne product requirements. \\nWorkshops are considered a primary technique for quickly de˜ning cross-functional requirements and reconciling \\n\\nstakeholder differences. Because of their interactive group nature, well-facilitated sessions can build trust, foster \\n\\nrelationships, and improve communication among the participants, which can lead to increased stakeholder \\n\\nconsensus. In addition, issues can be discovered earlier and resolved more quickly than in individual sessions.\\nFor example, facilitated workshops called joint application design/development (JAD) sessions are used in the \\nsoftware development industry. These facilitated sessions focus on bringing business subject matter experts and \\n\\nthe development team together to improve the software development process. In the manufacturing industry, quality \\n\\nfunction deployment (QFD) is another example of a facilitated workshop technique that helps determine critical \\n\\ncharacteristics for new product development. QFD starts by collecting customer needs, also known as voice of the \\n\\ncustomer (VOC). These needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized, and goals are set for achieving them. User \\n\\nstories, which are short, textual descriptions of required functionality, are often developed during a requirements \\n\\nworkshop. User stories describe the stakeholder who bene˜ts from the feature (role), what the stakeholder needs to \\n\\naccomplish (goal), and the bene˜t to the stakeholder (motivation). User stories are widely used with agile methods.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.115©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n5 - PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT55.2.2.4 Group Creativity TechniquesSeveral group activities can be organized to identify project and product requirements. Some of the group \\ncreativity techniques that can be used are:\\n Brainstorming. \\nA technique used to generate and collect multiple ideas related to project and product \\nrequirements. Although brainstorming by itself does not include voting or prioritization, it is often used \\n\\nwith other group creativity techniques that do.\\n N\\nominal group technique. A technique that enhances brainstorming with a voting process used to rank \\nthe most useful ideas for further brainstorming or for prioritization.\\n Idea/mind mapping. \\nA technique in which ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions are \\nconsolidated into a single map to re˚ect commonality and differences in understanding, and generate \\n\\nnew ideas. Affinity diagram.\\n A technique that allows large numbers of ideas to be classi˜ed into groups for review \\n\\nand analysis. Multicriteria decision analysis. A technique that utilizes a decision matrix to provide a systematic \\n\\nanalytical approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate \\n\\nand rank many ideas.\\n5.2.2.5 Group Decision-Making TechniquesA group decision-making technique is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected \\noutcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used to generate, classify, and prioritize product \\n\\nrequirements.There are various methods of reaching a group decision, such as:\\n Unanimity. \\nA decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action. One way to \\nreach unanimity is the Delphi technique, in which a selected group of experts answers questionnaires and \\n\\nprovides feedback regarding the responses from each round of requirements gathering. The responses \\n\\nare only available to the facilitator to maintain anonymity.\\n Majority.\\n A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50 % of the members of the \\n\\ngroup. Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be \\n\\nreached, rather than resulting in a tie.\\n Plurality. \\nA decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even if a majority is \\nnot achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options nominated is more than two.\\nDictatorship. \\nIn this method, one individual makes the decision for the group.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.116©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n5 - PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENTAll of these group decision-making techniques can be applied to the group creativity techniques used in the \\nCollect Requirements process. \\n5.2.2.6 Questionnaires and Surveys\\nQuestionnaires and surveys are written sets of questions designed to quickly accumulate information from a \\nlarge number of respondents. Questionnaires and/or surveys are most appropriate with varied audiences, when \\n\\na quick turnaround is needed, when respondents are geographically dispersed, and where statistical analysis is \\n\\nappropriate.\\n5.2.2.7 Observations\\nObservations provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their environment and how they perform their jobs or \\ntasks and carry out processes. It is particularly helpful for detailed processes when the people that use the product \\n\\nhave dif˜culty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements. Observation is also known as ﬁjob shadowing.ﬂ \\n\\nIt is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business expert performing a job. It can also be done by \\n\\na ﬁparticipant observerﬂ who actually performs a process or procedure to experience how it is done to uncover \\n\\nhidden requirements.5.2.2.8 PrototypesPrototyping is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a working model of the expected product before actually building it. Since a prototype is tangible, it allows stakeholders to experiment \\n\\nwith a model of the ˜nal product rather than being limited to discussing abstract representations of their \\n\\nrequirements. Prototypes support the concept of progressive elaboration in iterative cycles of mock-up creation, \\n\\nuser experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision. When enough feedback cycles have been \\n\\nperformed, the requirements obtained from the prototype are suf˜ciently complete to move to a design or build \\n\\nphase. Storyboarding is a prototyping technique showing sequence or navigation through a series of images or \\n\\nillustrations. Storyboards are used on a variety of projects in a variety of industries, such as ˜lm, advertising, \\n\\ninstructional design, and on agile and other software development projects. In software development, storyboards \\n\\nuse mock-ups to show navigation paths through webpages, screens, or other user interfaces.\\n5.2.2.9 BenchmarkingBenchmarking involves comparing actual or planned practices, such as processes and operations, to those \\nof comparable organizations to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide a basis for \\n\\nmeasuring performance. The organizations compared during benchmarking can be internal or external.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.117©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n5 - PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT55.2.2.10 Context \\nDiagramsThe context diagram is an example of a scope model. Context diagrams visually depict the product scope by \\nshowing a business system (process, equipment, computer system, etc.), and how people and other systems \\n\\n(actors) interact with it. Context diagrams show inputs to the business system, the actor(s) providing the input, the \\n\\noutputs from the business system, and the actor(s) receiving the output.\\n5.2.2.11 Document AnalysisDocument analysis is used to elicit requirements by analyzing existing documentation and identifying \\ninformation relevant to the requirements. There are a wide range of documents that may be analyzed to help elicit \\n\\nrelevant requirements. Examples of documents that may be analyzed include, but are not limited to: business plans, \\n\\nmarketing literature, agreements, requests for proposal, current process ˚ows, logical data models, business rules \\n\\nrepositories, application software documentation, business process or interface documentation, use cases, other \\n\\nrequirements documentation, problem/issue logs, policies, procedures, and regulatory documentation such as \\n\\nlaws, codes, or ordinances, etc.\\n5.2.3 Collect Requirements: Outputs5.2.3.1 Requirements DocumentationRequirements documentation describes how individual requirements meet the business need for the project. \\nRequirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more about the requirements \\n\\nis known. Before being baselined, requirements need to be unambiguous (measurable and testable), traceable, \\n\\ncomplete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of a requirements document may range from \\n\\na simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate forms \\n\\ncontaining an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments.\\nComponents of requirements documentation can include, but, are not limited to:\\nBusiness requirements, including:\\n ˜Business and project objectives for traceability; ˜Business rules for the performing organization; and\\n ˜Guiding principles of the organization.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.118©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n5 - PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENTStakeholder requirements, including:\\n ˜Impacts to other organizational areas;\\n ˜Impacts to other entities inside or outside the performing organization; and\\n ˜Stakeholder communication and reporting requirements.\\nSolution requirements, including:\\n ˜Functional and nonfunctional requirements; ˜Technology and standard compliance requirements;\\n ˜Support and training requirements; ˜Quality requirements; and ˜ Reporting requirements, etc. (solution requirements can be documented textually, in models,  \\nor both).Project requirements, such as:\\n ˜Levels of service, performance, safety, compliance, etc.; and\\n ˜Acceptance criteria.Transition requirements.\\nRequirements assumptions, dependencies, and constraints.\\n5.2.3.2 Requirements Traceability MatrixThe requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the \\ndeliverables that satisfy them. The implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each \\n\\nrequirement adds business value by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means \\n\\nto track requirements throughout the project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the \\n\\nrequirements documentation are delivered at the end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing \\n\\nchanges to the product scope.Tracing includes, but is not limited to, tracing requirements for the following:\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.119©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n5 - PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT5Business needs, opportunities, goals, and objectives;\\nProject objectives;Project scope/WBS deliverables;Product design;Product development;Test strategy and test scenarios; and\\nHigh-level requirements to more detailed requirements.Attributes associated with each requirement can be recorded in the requirements traceability matrix.

The project scope statement documents the entire scope, including project and product scope. It \\n\\ndescribes, in detail, the project™s deliverables and the work required to create those deliverables. It also provides a \\n\\ncommon understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders. It may contain explicit scope exclusions \\n\\nthat can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the project team to perform more detailed planning, \\n\\nguides the project team™s work during execution, and provides the baseline for evaluating whether requests for \\n\\nchanges or additional work are contained within or outside the project™s boundaries.\\nThe degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement de˜nes the work that will be performed \\nand the work that is excluded can help determine how well the project management team can control the overall \\n\\nproject scope.

When a project is performed under an agreement, contractual provisions will generally be \\n\\nconstraints. Information on constraints may be listed in the project scope statement or in a separate log.\\n Assumptions. A factor in the planning process that is considered to be true, real, or certain, without \\n\\nproof or demonstration. Also describes the potential impact of those factors if they prove to be false. \\n\\nProject teams frequently identify, document, and validate assumptions as part of their planning process. \\n\\nInformation on assumptions may be listed in the project scope statement or in a separate log.\\nAlthough the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing a certain \\ndegree of redundancy, they are different in the level of detail contained in each.

The work package is the work de˜ned at the lowest level of the WBS for which \\n\\ncost and duration can be estimated and managed. The level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of \\n\\ncontrol needed to effectively manage the project. The level of detail for work packages will vary with the size \\n\\nand complexity of the project. Decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the \\n\\nfollowing activities:\\nIdentifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work;\\nStructuring and organizing the WBS;\\nDecomposing the upper WBS levels into lower-level detailed components;\\nDeveloping and assigning identi˜cation codes to the WBS components; and\\nVerifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate.\\nA portion of a WBS with some branches of the WBS decomposed down through the work package level is shown \\nin Figure 5-11.\\n5.4.2.2 Expert JudgmentExpert judgment is often used to analyze the information needed to decompose the project deliverables down \\ninto smaller component parts in order to create an effective WBS. Such judgment and expertise is applied to \\n\\ntechnical details of the project™s scope and used to reconcile differences in opinion on how to best break down \\n\\nthe overall scope of the project. This level of expertise is provided by any group or individual with relevant training, \\n\\nknowledge, or experience with similar projects or business areas. Expert judgment can also come in the form \\n\\nof prede˜ned templates that provide guidance on how to effectively break down common deliverables. Such \\n\\ntemplates may be industry or discipline speci˜c or may come from experience gained in similar projects.

The WBS may be structured as an outline, an organizational chart, or other method that identi˜es \\n\\na hierarchical breakdown. Verifying the correctness of the decomposition requires determining that the lower-level \\n\\nWBS components are those that are necessary and suf˜cient for completion of the corresponding higher-level \\n\\ndeliverables. Different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition. To arrive at a work package, the \\n\\nwork for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level, while others need additional levels of \\n\\ndecomposition. As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and control the \\n\\nwork is enhanced. However, excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort, inef˜cient \\n\\nuse of resources, decreased ef˜ciency in performing the work, and dif˜culty aggregating data over different levels \\n\\nof the WBS.\\nDecomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the \\nfuture. The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on, so the \\n\\ndetails of the WBS can be developed. This technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning.\\nThe WBS represents all product and project work, including the project management work. The total of the work \\nat the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed. \\n\\nThis is sometimes called the 100 percent rule.For speci˜c information regarding the WBS, refer to the \\nPractice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures\\n Œ Second Edition [7]. This standard contains industry-speci˜c examples of WBS templates that can be tailored to \\n\\nspeci˜c projects in a particular application area.\\n5.4.3 Create WBS: Outputs5.4.3.1 Scope BaselineThe scope baseline is the approved version of a scope statement, work breakdown structure (WBS), and its \\nassociated WBS dictionary, that can be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used as a \\n\\nbasis for comparison.

Components of the scope baseline include:\\n Project scope statement. \\nThe project scope statement includes the description of the project scope, \\n\\nmajor deliverables, assumptions, and constraints.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.132©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n5 - PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT WBS. \\nThe WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project \\nteam to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. Each descending level \\n\\nof the WBS represents an increasingly detailed de˜nition of the project work. The WBS is ˜nalized by \\n\\nassigning each work package to a control account and establishing a unique identi˜er for that work \\n\\npackage from a code of accounts. These identi˜ers provide a structure for hierarchical summation \\n\\nof costs, schedule, and resource information. A control account is a management control point \\n\\nwhere scope, budget, actual cost, and schedule are integrated and compared to the earned value for \\n\\nperformance measurement. Control accounts are placed at selected management points in the WBS. \\n\\nEach control account may include one or more work packages, but each of the work packages should \\n\\nbe associated with only one control account.

These \\n\\nprocesses are presented here as distinct elements because the tools and techniques for each process are different.The Project Time Management processes and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the \\nschedule management plan. The schedule management plan is a subsidiary plan of, and integrated with, the project \\n\\nmanagement plan through the Develop Project Management Plan process (Section 4.2), The schedule management \\n\\nplan identi˜es a scheduling method and scheduling tool (Figure 6-2), and sets the format and establishes criteria \\n\\nfor developing and controlling the project schedule. The selected scheduling method de˜nes the framework and \\n\\nalgorithms used in the scheduling tool to create the schedule model. Some of the better known scheduling methods \\n\\ninclude critical path method (CPM) and critical chain method (CCM).\\nProject schedule development uses the outputs from the processes to de˜ne activities, sequence activities, \\nestimate activity resources, and estimate activity durations in combination with the scheduling tool to produce \\n\\nthe schedule model. The ˜nalized and approved schedule is the baseline that will be used in the Control Schedule \\n\\nprocess (Section 6.7). As the project activities are being performed, the majority of effort in the Project Time \\n\\nManagement Knowledge Area will occur in the Control Schedule process to ensure completion of project work in a \\n\\ntimely manner. Figure 6-2 provides a scheduling overview that shows how the scheduling method, scheduling tool, \\n\\nand outputs from the Project Time Management processes interact to create a project schedule.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.143©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT6.1 Inputs\\n .1 Project management plan\\n .2 Project charter\\n .3 Enterprise environmental  \\n  factors\\n .4 Organizational process   \\n  assets\\n.2 Tools & Techniques\\n .1 Expert judgment\\n .2 Analytical techniques\\n .3 Meetings\\n.3 Outputs\\n .1 Schedule management   \\n  plan\\nProject TimeManagement Overview6.1 Plan ScheduleManagement.1 Inputs\\n .1 Schedule management   \\n  plan\\n .2 Scope baseline\\n .3 Enterprise environmental  \\n  factors\\n .4 Organizational process   \\n  assets\\n.2 Tools & Techniques\\n .1 Decomposition\\n .2 Rolling wave planning\\n .3 Expert judgment\\n.3 Outputs\\n .1 Activity list\\n .2 Activity attributes\\n .3 Milestone list\\n6.2 Define Activities.1 Inputs\\n .1 Schedule management   \\n  plan\\n .2 Activity list\\n .3 Activity attributes\\n .4 Milestone list\\n .5 Project scope statement\\n .6 Enterprise environmental           \\n  factors\\n .7 Organizational process   \\n  assets\\n.2 Tools & Techniques\\n .1 Precedence diagramming  \\n  method (PDM)\\n .2 Dependency determination\\n .3 Leads and lags\\n  \\n.3 Outputs\\n .1 Project schedule network\\n  diagrams\\n .2 Project documents updates\\n6.3 Sequence\\nActivities.1 Inputs\\n .1 Schedule management   \\n  plan\\n .2 Activity list\\n .3 Activity attributes\\n .4 Activity resource   \\n  requirements\\n .5 Resource calendars\\n .6 Project scope statement\\n .7 Risk register\\n .8 Resource breakdown   \\n  structure\\n .9 Enterprise environmental  \\n  factors\\n   .10 Organizational process   \\n  assets\\n.2 Tools & Techniques\\n .1 Expert judgment\\n .2 Analogous estimating\\n .3 Parametric estimating\\n .4 Three-point estimating\\n .5 Group decision-making \\n         techniques\\n .6 Reserve analysis\\n.3 Outputs\\n\\n .1 Activity duration estimates\\n .2 Project documents updates\\n6.5 Estimate ActivityDurations.1 Inputs\\n\\n .1 Schedule management   \\n\\n  plan\\n\\n .2 Activity list\\n .3 Activity attributes\\n\\n .4 Project schedule network  \\n\\n  diagrams\\n\\n .5 Activity resource   \\n  requirements\\n\\n .6 Resource calendars\\n\\n .7 Activity duration estimates\\n .8 Project scope statement\\n\\n .9 Risk register\\n\\n   .10 Project staff assignments\\n   .11 Resource breakdown   \\n\\n  structure\\n\\n  .12 Enterprise environmental  \\n\\n  factors\\n  .13 Organizational process   \\n\\n  assets\\n.2 Tools & Techniques\\n\\n .1 Schedule network analysis\\n .2 Critical path method\\n\\n .3 Critical chain method\\n\\n .4 Resource optimization   \\n  techniques\\n\\n .5 Modeling techniques\\n\\n .6 Leads and lags\\n\\n .7 Schedule compression\\n .8 Scheduling tool\\n.3 Outputs\\n\\n .1 Schedule baseline\\n\\n .2 Project schedule\\n .3 Schedule data\\n\\n .4 Project calendars\\n\\n .5 Project management plan  \\n  updates\\n\\n .6 Project documents updates\\n6.6 Develop Schedule.1 Inputs\\n\\n .1 Project management plan\\n\\n .2 Project schedule\\n\\n .3 Work performance data\\n .4 Project calendars\\n\\n .5 Schedule data\\n\\n .6 Organizational process   \\n\\n  assets\\n.2 Tools & Techniques\\n .1 Performance reviews\\n .2 Project management   \\n\\n  software\\n\\n .3 Resource optimization   \\n  techniques\\n\\n .4 Modeling techniques\\n\\n .5 Leads and lags\\n .6 Schedule compression\\n\\n .7 Scheduling tool\\n.3 Outputs\\n .1 Work performance   \\n\\n  information\\n\\n .2 Schedule forecasts\\n\\n .3 Change requests\\n\\n .4 Project management plan  \\n\\n  updates\\n\\n .5 Project documents updates\\n\\n .6 Organizational process   \\n\\n  assets updates\\n6.7 Control Schedule.1 Inputs\\n\\n .1 Schedule management   \\n\\n  plan\\n\\n .2 Activity list\\n\\n .3 Activity attributes\\n\\n .4 Resource calendars\\n\\n .5 Risk register\\n\\n .6 Activity cost estimates\\n\\n .7 Enterprise environmental  \\n  factors\\n\\n .8 Organizational process   \\n\\n  assets\\n.2 Tools & Techniques\\n .1 Expert judgment\\n\\n .2 Alternative analysis\\n\\n .3 Published estimating data\\n\\n .4 Bottom-up estimating\\n\\n .5 Project management   \\n\\n  software\\n.3 Outputs\\n\\n .1 Activity resource\\n  requirements\\n\\n .2 Resource breakdown   \\n  structure\\n\\n .3 Project documents   \\n\\n  updates\\n6.4 Estimate ActivityResourcesFigure 6-1.

Activity-on-node (AON) is one method of representing a \\n\\nprecedence diagram. This is the method used by most project management software packages.\\nPDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that \\nlogically comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically \\n\\ncomes after another activity in a schedule. These relationships are de˜ned below and are illustrated in Figure 6-9:\\n Finish-to-start (FS). \\nA logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor \\n\\nactivity has ˜nished. Example: The awards ceremony (successor) cannot start until the race (predecessor) \\n\\nhas ˜nished. Finish-to-finish (FF). \\nA logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ˜nish until a predecessor \\n\\nactivity has ˜nished. Example: Writing a document (predecessor) is required to ˜nish before editing the \\n\\ndocument (successor) can ˜nish. Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor \\n\\nactivity has started. Example: Level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) \\n\\nbegins. Start-to-finish (SF).

Technical \\n\\ndependencies may not be mandatory. The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory \\n\\nduring the process of sequencing the activities. Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with \\n\\nassigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.Licensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.158©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT Discretionary dependencies. \\nDiscretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic, \\npreferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best \\n\\npractices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a speci˜c \\n\\nsequence is desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. Discretionary dependencies \\n\\nshould be fully documented since they can create arbitrary total ˚oat values and can limit later scheduling \\n\\noptions. When fast tracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be \\n\\nreviewed and considered for modi˜cation or removal. The project team determines which dependencies \\n\\nare discretionary during the process of sequencing the activities.\\n External dependencies. \\nExternal dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and \\nnon-project activities. These dependencies are usually outside the project team™s control. For example, \\n\\nthe testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external \\n\\nsource, or governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin \\n\\non a construction project. The project management team determines which dependencies are external \\n\\nduring the process of sequencing the activities. Internal dependencies.\\n Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project \\n\\nactivities and are generally inside the project team™s control. For example, if the team cannot test a \\n\\nmachine until they assemble it, this is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team \\n\\ndetermines which dependencies are internal during the process of sequencing the activities.6.3.2.3 Leads and LagsA lead is the amount of time whereby a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example, on a project to construct a new of˜ce building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start \\n\\ntwo weeks prior to the scheduled punch list completion. This would be shown as a ˜nish-to-start with a two-week \\n\\nlead as shown in Figure 6-10. Lead is often represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.\\nCompletePunch ListWriteDraft\\nLandscapeBuilding LotEditDraft\\nSS Œ 15 Days (Lag)\\nFS Œ 2 Weeks (Lead)\\nFigure 6-10.

This can be shown as a start-to-start relationship with a 15-day lag as shown in Figure 6-10. Lag can \\n\\nalso be represented in project schedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 6-11 in the relationship between \\n\\nactivities H and I, as indicated by the nomenclature SS+10 (start-to-start plus 10 days lag) even though offset is \\n\\nnot shown relative to a timescale.\\nThe project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately \\nde˜ne the logical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Activities and their \\n\\nrelated assumptions should be documented.\\n6.3.3 Sequence Activities: Outputs6.3.3.1 Project Schedule Network DiagramsA project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as \\ndependencies, among the project schedule activities.

A resource calendar is a calendar that identi˜es the working \\n\\ndays and shifts on which each speci˜c resource is available. Information on which resources (such as human \\n\\nresources, equipment, and material) are potentially available during a planned activity period, is used for \\n\\nestimating resource utilization. Resource calendars specify when and how long identi˜ed project resources \\n\\nwill be available during the project. This information may be at the activity or project level. This knowledge \\n\\nincludes consideration of attributes such as resource experience and/or skill level, as well as various \\n\\ngeographical locations from which the resources originate and when they may be available. \\n6.4.1.5 Risk RegisterDescribed in Section 11.2.3.1.

Any group or person \\nwith specialized knowledge in resource planning and estimating can provide such expertise.\\n6.4.2.2 Alternative AnalysisMany schedule activities have alternative methods of accomplishment. They include using various levels of \\nresource capability or skills, different size or type of machines, different tools (hand versus automated), and make-\\n\\nrent-or-buy decisions regarding the resource (Section 12.1.3.5).\\n6.4.2.3 Published Estimating DataSeveral organizations routinely publish updated production rates and unit costs of resources for an extensive \\narray of labor trades, material, and equipment for different countries and geographical locations within countries.\\n6.4.2.4 Bottom-Up EstimatingBottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the \\nlower-level components of the WBS. When an activity cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of con˜dence, \\n\\nthe work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The resource needs are estimated. These estimates \\n\\nare then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity™s resources. Activities may or may not have \\n\\ndependencies between them that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this \\n\\npattern of resource usage is re˚ected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity.\\n6.4.2.5 Project Management SoftwareProject management software, such as a scheduling software tool, has the capability to help plan, organize, and \\nmanage resource pools and develop resource estimates. Depending on the sophistication of the software, resource \\n\\nbreakdown structures, resource availability, resource rates, and various resource calendars can be de˜ned to assist \\n\\nin optimizing resource utilization.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.165©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT66.4.3 Estimate Activity Resources: Outputs6.4.3.1 Activity Resource RequirementsActivity resource requirements identify the types and quantities of resources required for each activity in a work package.

The inputs of the estimates of activity duration originate from the \\n\\nperson or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the speci˜c activity. The \\n\\nduration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the input \\n\\ndata. For example, as more detailed and precise data is available about the project engineering and design work, \\n\\nthe accuracy of the duration estimates improves. Thus, the duration estimate can be assumed to be progressively \\n\\nmore accurate and of better quality.\\nThe Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete \\nthe activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used to \\n\\napproximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate \\n\\nproject and resource calendars. All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for \\n\\neach estimate of activity duration.\\n6.5.1 Estimate Activity Durations: Inputs6.5.1.1 Schedule Management PlanDescribed in Section 6.1.3.1.

The estimated activity resource requirements will have an effect on the duration of \\nthe activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meet the requirements will signi˜cantly \\n\\nin˚uence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lower-skilled resources are assigned to an \\n\\nactivity, there may be reduced ef˜ciency or productivity due to increased communication, training, and coordination \\n\\nneeds leading to a longer duration estimate.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.168©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT6.5.1.5 Resource CalendarsDescribed in Section 6.4.1.4.

Expert judgment can also be used to determine whether to \\n\\ncombine methods of estimating and how to reconcile differences between them.\\n6.5.2.2 Analogous EstimatingAnalogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using \\nhistorical data from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, \\n\\nsimilar project, such as duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same \\n\\nparameter or measure for a future project. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual \\n\\nduration of previous, similar projects as the basis for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a \\n\\ngross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known differences in project complexity. Analogous \\n\\nduration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when there is a limited amount of detailed \\n\\ninformation about the project.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.170©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENTAnalogous estimating is generally less costly and less time consuming than other techniques, but it is also \\nless accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may \\n\\nbe used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous \\n\\nactivities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates \\n\\nhave the needed expertise.\\n6.5.2.3 Parametric Estimating\\nParametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration \\nbased on historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between \\n\\nhistorical data and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity \\n\\nparameters, such as cost, budget, and duration.\\nActivity durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by labor \\nhours per unit of work. For example, activity duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings \\n\\nmultiplied by the number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the \\n\\nnumber of labor hours per meter. For example, if the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable \\n\\nper hour, the duration required to install 1,000 meters is 40 hours. (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).\\nThis technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending upon the sophistication and underlying data \\nbuilt into the model. Parametric time estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in \\n\\nconjunction with other estimating methods.\\n6.5.2.4 Three-Point Estimating\\nThe accuracy of single-point activity duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty \\nand risk. This concept originated with the program evaluation and review technique (PERT). PERT uses three \\n\\nestimates to de˜ne an approximate range for an activity™s duration:\\n Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be \\n\\nassigned, their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other \\n\\nparticipants, and interruptions.\\nOptimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.\\nPessimistic\\n (tP). The activity duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.171©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT6Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates the expected duration, \\ntE, can be calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The \\n\\nformulas are:Triangular Distribution. tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3Beta Distribution (from the traditional PERT technique). \\ntE = (tO + 4tM + tP) / 6Duration estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify \\nthe range of uncertainty around the expected duration.\\n6.5.2.5 Group Decision-Making TechniquesTeam-based approaches, such as brainstorming, the Delphi or nominal group techniques, are useful for engaging \\nteam members to improve estimate accuracy and commitment to the emerging estimates. By involving a structured \\n\\ngroup of people who are close to the technical execution of work in the estimation process, additional information \\n\\nis gained and more accurate estimates obtained. Additionally, when people are involved in the estimation process, \\n\\ntheir commitment towards meeting the resulting estimates increases.\\n6.5.2.6 Reserve Analysis\\nDuration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as time reserves or buffers, \\ninto the project schedule to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration \\n\\nwithin the schedule baseline, which is allocated for identi˜ed risks that are accepted and for which contingent or \\n\\nmitigation responses are developed. Contingency reserves are associated with the ﬁknown-unknowns,ﬂ which may \\n\\nbe estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the \\n\\nestimated activity duration, a ˜xed number of work periods, or may be developed by using quantitative analysis \\n\\nmethods such as Monte Carlo simulation (Section 11.4.2.2). Contingency reserves may be separated from the \\n\\nindividual activities and aggregated into buffers as shown in Figure 6-19.\\nAs more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, \\nreduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identi˜ed in schedule documentation.\\nEstimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of time for the project. Management \\nreserves are a speci˜ed amount of the project duration withheld for management control purposes and are \\n\\nreserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the \\n\\nﬁunknown-unknownsﬂ that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline, but \\n\\nit is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management reserves \\n\\nmay require a change to the schedule baseline.Licensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.172©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT6.5.3 Estimate Activity Durations: Outputs6.5.3.1 Activity Duration EstimatesActivity duration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required \\nto complete an activity.

Schedule development can require the review and revision of duration estimates and resource estimates to \\n\\ncreate the project schedule model to establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track \\n\\nprogress. Once the activity start and ˜nish dates have been determined, it is common to have project staff assigned \\n\\nto the activities review their assigned activities and con˜rm that the start and ˜nish dates present no con˚ict with \\n\\nresource calendars or assigned activities in other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. As work progresses, \\n\\nrevising and maintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the \\nduration of the project, as described in Section 6.7.\\nFor more speci˜c information regarding scheduling, refer to the \\nPractice Standard for Scheduling.6.6.1 Develop Schedule: Inputs6.6.1.1 Schedule Management PlanDescribed in Section 6.1.3.1.

It employs various analytical \\ntechniques, such as critical path method, critical chain method, what-if analysis, and resource optimization \\n\\ntechniques to calculate the early and late start and ˜nish dates for the uncompleted portions of project activities. \\n\\nSome network paths may have points of path convergence or path divergence that can be identi˜ed and used in \\n\\nschedule compression analysis or other analyses.6.6.2.2 Critical Path Method\\nThe critical path method, which is a method used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the \\namount of scheduling ˚exibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network \\n\\nanalysis technique calculates the early start, early ˜nish, late start, and late ˜nish dates for all activities without \\n\\nregard for any resource limitations by performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule \\n\\nnetwork, as shown in Figure 6-18. In this example the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and, therefore, the \\n\\nsequence of A-C-D is the critical path. The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path \\n\\nthrough a project, which determines the shortest possible project duration. The resulting early and late start and \\n\\n˜nish dates are not necessarily the project schedule, rather they indicate the time periods within which the activity \\n\\ncould be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical relationships, \\n\\nleads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the amount of scheduling \\n\\n˚exibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.177©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT6On any network path, the schedule ˚exibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule activity can \\nbe delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project ˜nish date or violating a schedule \\n\\nconstraint, and is termed ﬁtotal ˚oat.ﬂ A CPM critical path is normally characterized by zero total ˚oat on the \\n\\ncritical path. As implemented with PDM sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total \\n\\n˚oat depending on constraints applied. Any activity on the critical path is called a critical path activity. Positive \\n\\ntotal ˚oat is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a schedule constraint that is later than the \\n\\nearly ˜nish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation. Negative total ˚oat is caused when a \\n\\nconstraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Schedule networks may have multiple near-critical \\n\\npaths. Many software packages allow the user to de˜ne the parameters used to determine the critical path(s). \\n\\nAdjustments to activity durations (if more resources or less scope can be arranged), logical relationships (if the \\n\\nrelationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and lags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary \\n\\nto produce network paths with a zero or positive total ˚oat. Once the total ˚oat for a network path has been \\n\\ncalculated, then the free ˚oatŠthe amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed without delaying the \\n\\nearly start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraintŠcan also be determined.

It is developed from the critical \\n\\npath method approach and considers the effects of resource allocation, resource optimization, resource leveling, \\n\\nand activity duration uncertainty on the critical path determined using the critical path method. To do so, the critical \\n\\nchain method introduces the concept of buffers and buffer management. The critical chain method uses activities \\n\\nwith durations that do not include safety margins, logical relationships, and resource availability with statistically \\n\\ndetermined buffers composed of the aggregated safety margins of activities at speci˜ed points on the project \\n\\nschedule path to account for limited resources and project uncertainties. The resource-constrained critical path is \\n\\nknown as the critical chain.\\nThe critical chain method adds duration buffers that are non-work schedule activities to manage uncertainty. \\nOne buffer, placed at the end of the critical chain, as shown in Figure 6-19, is known as the project buffer and \\n\\nprotects the target ˜nish date from slippage along the critical chain. Additional buffers, known as feeding buffers, \\n\\nare placed at each point where a chain of dependent activities that are not on the critical chain feeds into the critical \\n\\nchain. Feeding buffers thus protect the critical chain from slippage along the feeding chains. The size of each buffer \\n\\nshould account for the uncertainty in the duration of the chain of dependent activities leading up to that buffer. Once \\n\\nthe buffer schedule activities are determined, the planned activities are scheduled to their latest possible planned \\n\\nstart and ˜nish dates. Consequently, instead of managing the total ˚oat of network paths, the critical chain method \\n\\nfocuses on managing the remaining buffer durations against the remaining durations of chains of activities.\\nActivity A\\nCritical Chain Link\\nNon-Critical LinkActivity CStart\\nFinish\\nActivity GActivity BActivity DFeeding\\nBufferFeeding\\nBufferActivity EActivity FProjectBufferKEYFigure 6-19.

Resource leveling can be used \\n\\nwhen shared or critically required resources are only available at certain times, or in limited quantities, \\n\\nor over-allocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same \\n\\ntime period, as shown in Figure 6-20, or to keep resource usage at a constant level.

In resource \\n\\nsmoothing, as opposed to resource leveling, the project™s critical path is not changed and the completion \\n\\ndate may not be delayed. In other words, activities may only be delayed within their free and total ˚oat. \\n\\nThus resource smoothing may not be able to optimize all resources.6.6.2.5 Modeling TechniquesExamples of modeling techniques include, but are not limited to:\\n What-If Scenario Analysis. \\nWhat-if scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order \\n\\nto predict their effect, positively or negatively, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, \\n\\nﬁWhat if the situation represented by scenario ‚X™ happens?ﬂ A schedule network analysis is performed \\n\\nusing the schedule to compute the different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, \\n\\nextending speci˜c engineering durations, or introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in \\n\\nthe permitting process. The outcome of the what-if scenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility \\n\\nof the project schedule under adverse conditions, and in preparing contingency and response plans to \\n\\novercome or mitigate the impact of unexpected situations.\\n Simulation. Simulation involves calculating multiple project durations with different sets of activity \\n\\nassumptions, usually using probability distributions constructed from the three-point estimates (described \\n\\nin Section 6.5.2.4) to account for uncertainty. The most common simulation technique is Monte Carlo \\n\\nanalysis (Section 11.4.2.2), in which a distribution of possible activity durations is de˜ned for each activity \\n\\nand used to calculate a distribution of possible outcomes for the total project.\\n6.6.2.6 Leads and LagsDescribed in Section 6.3.2.3. Leads and lags are re˜nements applied during network analysis to develop a \\nviable schedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to \\n\\nadvance a successor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances \\n\\nwhere processes require a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or \\n\\nresource impact.Licensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.181©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT66.6.2.7 Schedule CompressionSchedule compression techniques are used to shorten the schedule duration without reducing the project \\nscope, in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. Schedule compression \\n\\ntechniques include, but are not limited to:\\n Crashing. \\nA technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding \\nresources. Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying \\n\\nto expedite delivery to activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path \\n\\nwhere additional resources will shorten the activity™s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable \\n\\nalternative and may result in increased risk and/or cost.\\n Fast tracking.\\n A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence \\n\\nare performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation \\n\\nfor a building before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and \\n\\nincreased risk. Fast tracking only works if activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration.\\n6.6.2.8 Scheduling ToolAutomated scheduling tools contain the schedule model and expedite the scheduling process by generating \\nstart and ˜nish dates based on the inputs of activities, network diagrams, resources and activity durations using \\n\\nschedule network analysis. A scheduling tool can be used in conjunction with other project management software \\n\\napplications as well as manual methods.\\n6.6.3 Develop Schedule: Outputs6.6.3.1 Schedule BaselineA schedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal \\nchange control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by \\n\\nthe appropriate stakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline ˜nish dates. During \\n\\nmonitoring and controlling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and ˜nish dates to determine \\n\\nwhether variances have occurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.182©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT6.6.3.2 Project ScheduleThe outputs from a schedule model are schedule presentations. The project schedule is an output of a schedule \\nmodel that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and resources. At a minimum, the \\n\\nproject schedule includes a planned start date and planned ˜nish date for each activity. If resource planning is done \\n\\nat an early stage, then the project schedule remains preliminary until resource assignments have been con˜rmed \\n\\nand scheduled start and ˜nish dates are established. This process usually occurs no later than the completion of the \\n\\nproject management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also be developed with a de˜ned \\n\\ntarget start and target ˜nish for each activity. The project schedule presentation may be presented in summary \\n\\nform, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although a \\n\\nproject schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more \\n\\nof the following formats, which are classi˜ed as presentations:\\n Bar charts. \\nThese charts, also known as Gantt charts, represent schedule information where activities \\nare listed on the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown \\n\\nas horizontal bars placed according to start and ˜nish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read, \\n\\nand are frequently used in management presentations. For control and management communications, \\n\\nthe broader, more comprehensive summary activity, sometimes referred to as a hammock activity, is \\n\\nused between milestones or across multiple interdependent work packages, and is displayed in bar \\n\\nchart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 6-21 that is presented in a WBS-\\n\\nstructured format.\\n Milestone charts.\\n These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or \\n\\ncompletion of major deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule \\n\\nportion of Figure 6-21.\\n Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activity-on-node \\n\\ndiagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a \\n\\npure logic diagram, as shown in Figure 6-11, or presented in a time-scaled schedule network diagram \\n\\nformat that is sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 6-21.These \\n\\ndiagrams, with activity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project™s \\n\\ncritical path schedule activities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series \\n\\nof related activities. Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a time-scaled logic \\n\\ndiagram. These diagrams include a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the \\n\\nlogical relationships. It is optimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of \\n\\nactivities may appear on the same line of the diagram in sequence.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.183©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT6Project Schedule Time Frame\\nPeriod 5\\nPeriod 1Period 2Period 3\\nActivityIdentifier\\n1.1.MBBegin New Product Z\\nPeriod 4\\nCalendarunitsCalendarunitsCalendarunitsComplete Component 1\\nComplete Component 2 Finish New Product Z\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0Activity DescriptionProject Schedule Time Frame\\nPeriod 5\\nPeriod 1Period 2Period 3\\nActivityIdentifier\\n1.1.MB012067\\n20\\n33\\n14053\\n14\\n28\\n11053\\n14\\n320\\n7\\n0Period 4\\nActivity Description1.1.1.M1\\n1.1.2.M1\\n1.1.3.MFComplete Integration of Components 1 & 2\\n01.1.3.M1Project Schedule Time Frame\\nPeriod 5\\nPeriod 1Period 2Period 3\\nActivityIdentifier\\n1.1Develop and Deliver New Product Z\\nPeriod 4\\nWork Package 1: Component 1 \\nWork Package 2: Component 2 \\nWork Package 3: Integrated Components 1 and 2\\n12067\\n53\\n53Activity Description1.1.1\\n1.1.2\\n1.1.3Milestone ScheduleData DateData DateDetailed Schedule1.1.1.T\\n1.1\\n1.1.1\\n1.1.1.D\\n1.1.1.B\\n1.1.2.T\\n1.1.1.M1\\n1.1.2\\n1.1.2.D\\n1.1.2.B\\n1.1.3.M1\\n1.1.2.M1\\n1.1.3\\n1.1.3.G\\n1.1.3.TData DateSSFS1.1.3.P\\n1.1.3.MFSummary Schedule\\nBegin New Product Z\\n Develop and Deliver Product Z\\n  Work Package 1: Component 1\\n  Design Component 1\\n  Build Component 1\\n  Test Component 1\\n  Complete Component 1\\n Work Package 2: Component 2\\n  Design Component 2\\n  Build Component 2\\n  Test Component 2\\n  Complete Component 2\\n Work Package 3: Integrated Components 1 and 2\\n  Integrate Components 1 and 2 as Product Z\\n  Complete Integration of Components 1 and 2\\n  Test Integrated Components as Product Z\\n  Deliver Product Z\\nFinish New Product Z\\nFigure 6-21.

The variance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end \\n\\ndate. Evaluating the progress of activities on near critical paths can identify schedule risk.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.189©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n6 - PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT6 C\\nritical chain method (Section 6.6.2.3). Comparing the amount of buffer remaining to the amount of buffer needed to protect the delivery date can help determine schedule status. The difference between \\n\\nthe buffer needed and the buffer remaining can determine whether corrective action is appropriate.\\n Earned value management (Section 7.4.2.1).\\n Schedule performance measurements such as schedule \\nvariance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI), are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the \\n\\noriginal schedule baseline. The total ˚oat and early ˜nish variances are also essential planning components \\n\\nto evaluate project time performance. Important aspects of schedule control include determining the cause \\n\\nand degree of variance relative to the schedule baseline (Section 6.6.3.1), estimating the implications \\n\\nof those variances for future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action \\n\\nis required. For example, a major delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on \\n\\nthe overall project schedule, while a much shorter delay on a critical or near-critical activity may require \\n\\nimmediate action. For projects not using earned value management, similar variance analysis can be \\n\\nperformed by comparing planned activity start or ˜nish dates against actual start or ˜nish dates to \\n\\nidentify variances between the schedule baseline and actual project performance. Further analysis can \\n\\nbe performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule baseline and any \\n\\ncorrective or preventative actions needed.\\n6.7.2.2 Project Management SoftwareProject management software for scheduling provides the ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, \\nto report variances to and progress made against the schedule baseline, and to forecast the effects of changes \\n\\nto the project schedule model.6.7.2.3 Resource Optimization TechniquesDescribed in Section 6.6.2.4.

Different \\nstakeholders will measure project costs in different ways and at different times. For example, the cost of an \\n\\nacquired item may be measured when the acquisition decision is made or committed, the order is placed, the item \\n\\nis delivered, or the actual cost is incurred or recorded for project accounting purposes.\\nProject Cost Management is primarily concerned with the cost of the resources needed to complete project \\nactivities. Project Cost Management should also consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring \\n\\ncost of using, maintaining, and supporting the product, service, or result of the project. For example, limiting the \\n\\nnumber of design reviews can reduce the cost of the project but could increase the resulting product™s operating \\n\\ncosts.In many organizations, predicting and analyzing the prospective ˜nancial performance of the project™s product is \\nperformed outside of the project. In others, such as a capital facilities project, Project Cost Management can include \\n\\nthis work. When such predictions and analyses are included, Project Cost Management may address additional \\n\\nprocesses and numerous general ˜nancial management techniques such as return on investment, discounted cash \\n\\n˚ow, and investment payback analysis.\\nThe cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the \\ncost management processes so that performance of the processes will be ef˜cient and coordinated.\\n7.1 Plan Cost ManagementPlan Cost Management is the process that establishes the policies, procedures, and documentation for planning, \\nmanaging, expending, and controlling project costs.

The type and quantity of resources and the amount of time which those resources \\nare applied to complete the work of the project are major factors in determining the project cost. Schedule activity \\n\\nresources and their respective durations are used as key inputs to this process. Estimate Activity Resources (Section \\n\\n6.4) involves determining the availability of staff, the number of staff hours required, and quantities of material and \\n\\nequipment needed to perform schedule activities. It is closely coordinated with cost estimating. Activity duration \\n\\nestimates (Section 6.5.3.1) will affect cost estimates on any project where the project budget includes an allowance \\n\\nfor the cost of ˜nancing (including interest charges) and where resources are applied per unit of time for the \\n\\nduration of the activity. Activity duration estimates can also affect cost estimates that have time-sensitive costs \\n\\nincluded in them, such as union labor with regularly expiring collective bargaining agreements or materials with \\n\\nseasonal cost variations.\\n7.2.1.5 Risk RegisterDescribed in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register should be reviewed to consider risk response costs. Risks, \\nwhich can be either threats or opportunities, typically have an impact on both activity and overall project costs. As \\n\\na general rule, when the project experiences a negative risk event, the near-term cost of the project will usually \\n\\nincrease, and there will sometimes be a delay in the project schedule. In a similar way, the project team should \\n\\nbe sensitive to potential opportunities that can bene˜t the business either by directly reducing activity costs or by \\n\\naccelerating the schedule.\\n7.2.1.6 Enterprise Environmental Factors\\nDescribed in Section 2.1.5. The enterprise environmental factors that in˚uence the Estimate Costs process \\ninclude, but are not limited to:\\n Market conditions. These conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the \\n\\nmarket, from whom, and under what terms and conditions.

Expert judgment can also be used to determine whether to combine methods \\n\\nof estimating and how to reconcile differences between them.\\n7.2.2.2 Analogous EstimatingAnalogous cost estimating uses the values such as scope, cost, budget, and duration or measures of scale such \\nas size, weight, and complexity from a previous, similar project as the basis for estimating the same parameter \\n\\nor measurement for a current project. When estimating costs, this technique relies on the actual cost of previous, \\n\\nsimilar projects as the basis for estimating the cost of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, \\n\\nsometimes adjusted for known differences in project complexity.\\nAnalogous cost estimating is frequently used to estimate a value when there is a limited amount of detailed \\ninformation about the project, for example, in the early phases of a project. Analogous cost estimating uses \\n\\nhistorical information and expert judgment.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.205©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n7 - PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT7Analogous cost estimating is generally less costly and less time consuming than other techniques, but it is also \\ngenerally less accurate. Analogous cost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in \\n\\nconjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous projects are \\n\\nsimilar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates have the needed \\n\\nexpertise.7.2.2.3 Parametric Estimating\\nParametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data and other variables (e.g., \\nsquare footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique can produce higher \\n\\nlevels of accuracy depending upon the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametric cost \\n\\nestimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods.\\n7.2.2.4 Bottom-Up EstimatingBottom-up estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The cost of individual work packages or \\nactivities is estimated to the greatest level of speci˜ed detail. The detailed cost is then summarized or ﬁrolled upﬂ to \\n\\nhigher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and accuracy of bottom-up cost estimating \\n\\nare typically in˚uenced by the size and complexity of the individual activity or work package.\\n7.2.2.5 Three-Point Estimating\\nThe accuracy of single-point activity cost estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and \\nrisk and using three estimates to de˜ne an approximate range for an activity™s cost:\\n Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and \\n\\nany predicted expenses.\\nOptimistic (cO). The activity cost based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.\\nPessimistic\\n (cP). The activity cost based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.206©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n7 - PROJECT COST MANAGEMENTDepending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates the expected cost, cE, \\ncan be calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas \\n\\nare:Triangular Distribution. cE = (cO + cM + cP) / 3Beta Distribution (from a traditional PERT analysis). cE = (cO + 4cM + cP) / 6\\nCost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the \\nrange of uncertainty around the expected cost.7.2.2.6 Reserve Analysis\\nCost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances) to account for \\ncost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for identi˜ed risks, \\n\\nwhich are accepted and for which contingent or mitigating responses are developed. Contingency reserves are \\n\\noften viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the ﬁknown-unknownsﬂ that can affect a project. For \\n\\nexample, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, while the amount of this rework is unknown. \\n\\nContingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. Contingency reserves can \\n\\nprovide for a speci˜c activity, for the whole project, or both. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the \\n\\nestimated cost, a ˜xed number, or may be developed by using quantitative analysis methods.\\nAs more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, \\nreduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identi˜ed in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are \\n\\npart of the cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project.Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve to be funded for the project. \\nManagement reserves are an amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are \\n\\nreserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the \\n\\nﬁunknown unknownsﬂ that can affect a project. The management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but \\n\\nis part of the overall project budget and funding requirements. When an amount of management reserves is used \\n\\nto fund unforeseen work, the amount of management reserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an \\n\\napproved change to the cost baseline.\\n7.2.2.7 Cost of Quality (COQ)Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.2) may be used to prepare the activity cost estimate.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.207©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n7 - PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT77.2.2.8 Project Management SoftwareProject management software applications, computerized spreadsheets, simulation, and statistical tools are \\nused to assist with cost estimating. Such tools can simplify the use of some cost-estimating techniques and thereby \\n\\nfacilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives.\\n7.2.2.9 Vendor Bid Analysis\\nCost estimating methods may include analysis of what the project should cost, based on the responsive bids from \\nquali˜ed vendors. When projects are awarded to a vendor under competitive processes, additional cost estimating \\n\\nwork may be required of the project team to examine the price of individual deliverables and to derive a cost that \\n\\nsupports the ˜nal total project cost.7.2.2.10 Group Decision-Making TechniquesTeam-based approaches, such as brainstorming, the Delphi or nominal group techniques, are useful for engaging \\nteam members to improve estimate accuracy and commitment to the emerging estimates. By involving a structured \\n\\ngroup of people who are close to the technical execution of work in the estimation process, additional information is \\n\\ngained and more accurate estimates are obtained. Additionally, when people are involved in the estimation process, \\n\\ntheir commitment towards meeting the resulting estimates increases.\\n7.2.3 Estimate Costs: Outputs7.2.3.1 Activity Cost EstimatesActivity cost estimates are quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project \\nwork. Cost estimates can be presented in summary form or in detail. Costs are estimated for all resources that \\n\\nare applied to the activity cost estimate. This includes, but is not limited to, direct labor, materials, equipment, \\n\\nservices, facilities, information technology, and special categories such as cost of ˜nancing (including interest \\n\\ncharges), an in˚ation allowance, exchange rates, or a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included \\n\\nin the project estimate, can be included at the activity level or at higher levels.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.208©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n7 - PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT7.2.3.2 Basis of EstimatesThe amount and type of additional details supporting the cost estimate vary by application area.

It is a project management technique that requires the formation of an \\n\\nintegrated baseline against which performance can be measured for the duration of the project. The principles \\n\\nof EVM can be applied to all projects in any industry.

It is the \\n\\nauthorized budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure \\n\\ncomponent, not including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of \\n\\nthe project, but at a given moment, planned value de˜nes the physical work that should have been \\n\\naccomplished. The total of the PV is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline \\n\\n(PMB). The total planned value for the project is also known as budget at completion (BAC).\\n Earned value. \\nEarned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget \\nauthorized for that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. \\n\\nThe EV being measured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the \\n\\nauthorized PV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. \\n\\nProgress measurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in \\n\\nprogress. Project managers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively \\n\\nto determine the long-term performance trends. Actual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during \\n\\na speci˜c time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The \\n\\nAC needs to correspond in de˜nition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., \\n\\ndirect hours only, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; \\n\\nwhatever is spent to achieve the EV will be measured. \\nVariances from the approved baseline will also be monitored:\\n Schedule variance.\\n Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the \\n\\ndifference between the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead \\n\\nor behind the planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on \\n\\na project. It is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVM schedule variance is \\n\\na useful metric in that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. \\n\\nThe EVM schedule variance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the \\n\\nplanned values will have been earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path \\n\\nmethodology (CPM) scheduling and risk management. \\nEquation\\n: SV = EV Œ PV\\n Cost variance.\\n Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget de˜cit or surplus at a given point in time, \\nexpressed as the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It is a measure of cost performance \\n\\non a project. It is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end \\n\\nof the project will be the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. \\n\\nThe CV is particularly critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs \\n\\nspent.

It measures how ef˜ciently the project team is \\n\\nusing its time. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecast the \\n\\n˜nal project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than \\n\\nwas planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since \\n\\nthe SPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to \\n\\ndetermine whether the project will ˜nish ahead of or behind its planned ˜nish date. The SPI is equal to \\n\\nthe ratio of the EV to the PV. Equation: SPI = EV/PV\\n C\\nost performance index. \\nThe cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost ef˜ciency of budgeted \\nresources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVM \\n\\nmetric and measures the cost ef˜ciency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a \\n\\ncost overrun for work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance \\n\\nto date. The CPI is equal to the ratio of the EV to the AC.

If it becomes obvious that the \\n\\nBAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecasting the EAC involves \\n\\nmaking projections of conditions and events in the project™s future based on current performance information \\n\\nand other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated, updated, and reissued based \\n\\non work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project is executed. The work performance \\n\\ninformation covers the project™s past performance and any information that could impact the project in the future.\\nEACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC) \\nthe remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC, based \\n\\non its experience to date. The EVM method works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the required EAC \\n\\ncosts. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottom-up summation by the project manager \\n\\nand project team.The project manager™s bottom-up EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred for \\nthe work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC =  \\n\\nAC + Bottom-up ETC.The project manager™s manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representing various \\nrisk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typically used. While EVM data \\n\\nquickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods are described as follows:\\n EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. \\nThis EAC method accepts the actual project performance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and \\n\\npredicts that all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance \\n\\nis unfavorable, the assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when \\n\\nsupported by project risk analysis. \\nEquation\\n: EAC = AC + (BAC Œ EV)\\n EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes what the project has \\nexperienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performed \\n\\nat the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. \\nEquation\\n: \\nEAC = BAC / CPILicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.221©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n7 - PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT7 EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors.\\n In this forecast, the ETC work will \\nbe performed at an ef˜ciency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. This \\n\\nmethod is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of this \\n\\nmethod weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according to \\n\\nthe project manager™s judgment. \\nEquation\\n: EAC = AC + [(BAC Œ EV) / (CPI × SPI)]\\nEach of these approaches is applicable for any given project and will provide the project management team with \\nan ﬁearly warningﬂ signal if the EAC forecasts are not within acceptable tolerances.\\n7.4.2.3 To-Complete Performance Index (\\nTCPI)The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved \\nwith the remaining resources in order to meet a speci˜ed management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to \\n\\n˜nish the outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved \\n\\non the remaining work to meet a speci˜ed management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious \\n\\nthat the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC \\n\\nmay replace the BAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCPI based on the BAC: (BAC Œ EV) / (BAC Œ AC).\\nThe TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 7-13. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left as the \\nwork remaining (de˜ned as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either the BAC \\nminus the AC, or the EAC minus the AC).\\nIf the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 7-13), all future work of the project will need \\nto be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as re˚ected in the top line of Figure 7-13) to stay \\n\\nwithin the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgment call based on a number \\n\\nof considerations, including risk, schedule, and technical performance. This level of performance is displayed as \\n\\nthe TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI based on the EAC: (BAC Œ EV) / (EAC Œ AC). The EVM formulas are \\n\\nprovided in Table 7-1.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.222©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n7 - PROJECT COST MANAGEMENTStatus Date1.00>1\\n<1TCPI\\n(BAC)\\nTCPI\\n(EAC)\\nBaseline PlanCumulative\\nCPIFormula:\\n= TCPIWork Remaining\\n (BAC-EV)\\nFunds Remaining (BAC-AC) or (EAC-AC)\\nFigure 7-13. \\nTo-Complete Performance Index (\\nTCPI)7.4.2.4 Performance \\nReviewsPerformance reviews compare cost performance over time, schedule activities or work packages overrunning \\nand underrunning the budget, and estimated funds needed to complete work in progress. If EVM is being used, the \\n\\nfollowing information is determined:\\n Variance analysis.\\n Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause, impact, and corrective \\n\\nactions) for cost (CV = EV Œ AC), schedule (SV = EV Œ PV), and variance at completion (VAC = BAC Œ EAC) \\n\\nvariances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements. For projects \\n\\nnot using earned value management, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing planned \\n\\nactivity cost against actual activity cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual \\n\\nproject performance. Further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance \\n\\nrelative to the schedule baseline and any corrective or preventative actions needed. Cost performance \\n\\nmeasurements are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important \\n\\naspect of project cost control includes determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the \\n\\ncost baseline (Section 7.3.3.1) and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. The \\n\\npercentage range of acceptable variances will tend to decrease as more work is accomplished.\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.223©2013 Project Management Institute.\\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\\n® Guide) Œ Fifth Edition \\n7 - PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT7 Trend analysis. \\nTrend analysis examines project performance over time to determine if performance is \\nimproving or deteriorating.

developed with a de˜ned \n","\n","target start and target ˜nish for each activity.\n","The project schedule presentation may be presented in summary \n","\n","form, sometimes referred to as the master

are relatively easy to read, \n","\n","and are frequently used in management presentations.\n","For control and management communications, \n","\n","the broader, more comprehensive summary activity, sometimes referred to as a hammock activity, is \n","\n","used between milestones or across multiple interdependent work packages, and is displayed in bar \n","\n","chart reports.\n","An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 6-21 that is presented in a WBS-\n","\n","structured format.\n"," \n","Milestone charts.\n"," \n","These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the

network diagrams.\n","These diagrams are commonly presented in the activity-on-node \n","\n","diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a

schedule in Figure 6-21.These \n","\n","diagrams, with activity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project™s \n","\n","critical path schedule activities.\n","This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series \n","\n","of related activities.\n","Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a time-scaled logic \n","\n","diagram.\n","These diagrams include a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the \n","\n","logical relationships.\n","It is optimized to show the relationships

are relatively easy to read, \n","\n","and are frequently used in management presentations.\n","For control and management communications, \n","\n","the broader, more comprehensive summary activity,
